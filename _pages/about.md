As an Enterprise Architect, I am responsible for the technology that will deliver value to our customers.  I am a proven technology leader that has a passion for innovation.  
My philosophy for building software is start small and evolve rapidly by continuously delivering small batch changes and proving our assumptions.  

### Who I am: 

##### CUTTING-EDGE TECHNOLOGIST

I love technology.  I am a curious person who loves to see what other people and companies are doing to improve their lives as well as improve the lives of the consumers of the technology.  I am constantly learning.  I have never settled for what has worked in the past.  Technology is constantly improving and I love being on the bleeding-edge of these innovations.  Technology innovations enable business innovation.

##### LEAN THINKER 

Companies today are extremely wasteful.  Who cares that you hired the most expensive team of engineers to make a high quality product that is infinitely scalable, maintainable and orders of magnitude faster than all your competitors if you customers don’t want it.  I believe that you can create minimum viable products that can test your assumptions before building the wrong thing.  I am passionate about proving ideas and iterating on them rapidly once proven.

##### TEAM ENABLER 

It is my responsibility to help teams gain the trust of business operators.  Instead of being order takers, delivery teams can help shape business visions by providing critical early feedback proving or disproving assumptions and hypotheses.  I enable teams to gain this trust by establishing a learning framework through which all work flows.

##### CONTINUOUS IMPROVER 

I can do better.  If I have to run a script more than once to deploy software I’m doing it wrong.  If I have to fill out change tickets before my software is released to production, we’re doing it wrong.  If the team has to have a hardening spring before a release, we’re doing it wrong.  Did someone say “code freeze”, wrong.  I strive to improve process every day.  Every small improvement counts.  That hour spent today will reap weeks later.

##### COACH AND MENTOR  

People want to be better.  I don’t seek out the opportunity to coach and teach.  I rarely ask if someone needs help.  Yet most of my day is spent helping others in and out of my department.  Excellence is contagious.  I seek out help from people who excel in areas I do not.  I do not wait to be taught.  My peers seek advice from me because I have a proven track record of successful projects and they know I can solve problems.  

##### CURRENT PROJECTS
What am I working on now?  In my day job I just released an MVP that has the promise to increase sales.  That took two weeks to build.  For this project I chose React and Redux for the front-end because I love their component architecture and immutability philosophy.  The middle tier is C# and the database is SQL Server. The web site performs so well we had to add transitions because the user couldn’t tell the page changed when an action was taken.  This project is completely hosted in Azure.
In my off time I am working on a social web site.  I am experimenting with serverless PaaS offerings in AWS and Google Cloud Platform.
